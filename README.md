Our application for CPS 510 will be implementing an E-Learning System also known as a Learning Management System. We chose this idea because we are interested in e-learning and have become very accustomed to this throughout COVID. E-learning is the future of education, and we are excited to learn more about DBMS and use our learning to implement our own model that incorporates many learning models used today.
